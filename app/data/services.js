    longTextRte: `<p>Invasive species can have devastating impacts on the health and biodiversity of aquatic ecosystems, displacing native species and disrupting delicate ecological balances. At LBE, we specialize in developing comprehensive invasive species management plans to ensure early detection and rapid response to aquatic invasive species.</p>
      <p>Our process begins with thorough surveys and assessments to identify the presence, extent, and potential impacts of invasive species infestations in your water bodies.</p>
      <p>Based on our findings, we create custom-tailored management plans that incorporate a multi-faceted approach to managing, or where feasible, eradicating invasive species. This may include targeted removal efforts, such as manual harvesting, selective herbicide applications, and restoration of native species.</p>
      <p>In addition to control and eradication measures, our invasive species management plans also include strategies for preventing future invasions. We provide education and guidance on best practices for minimizing the risk of introducing invasive species, such as proper boat cleaning protocols and monitoring of potential entry points.</p>
      <p>Throughout the implementation of our management plans, we work closely with our clients, providing regular progress updates and making adjustments as needed to ensure the best possible outcomes. Our ultimate goal is to restore and maintain the ecological integrity of your aquatic environments, promoting the recovery and resilience of native species and habitats.</p>`,

    longTextRte: `<p>LBE conducts comprehensive biological and plant surveys to assess the health, diversity, and ecological value of aquatic habitats. Our team of experienced biologists and botanists utilizes scientifically rigorous methods to gather accurate and reliable data on the flora and fauna present in your waterbody.</p>
    <p>Our biological surveys encompass a wide range of taxa, including aquatic and wetland plants, algae, cyanobacteria, and macroinvertebrates. Our experts also collect data on habitat characteristics, such as water quality, substrate composition, and vegetation structure, to gain a holistic understanding of the ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Our plant surveys involve detailed inventories of aquatic vegetation communities. We use a combination of transect sampling, quadrat sampling, and point intercept techniques to identify and map plant species, assess their relative abundance, and characterize community structure. Our botanists have extensive knowledge of native and invasive plant species and can provide valuable insights into the health and sustainability of your plant communities.</p>
    <p>The data collected during our biological and plant surveys serve as the foundation for informed decision-making and effective management strategies. We provide detailed reports that summarize our findings, highlight key ecological trends and patterns, and offer recommendations for conservation, restoration, or management actions. Our team can also assist with the development of long-term monitoring programs to track changes in species populations and habitat conditions over time.</p>`,

Our team of experienced professionals utilizes state-of-the-art technologies and methodologies to gather high-resolution data on aquatic plant communities, shoreline characteristics, and underwater topography (not for navigation).</p>
    <p>Our point intercept surveys are designed to accurately map the distribution and abundance of aquatic plant species within your waterbody. Using a grid of predetermined sampling points, our team collects data on plant presence, density, and species composition at each location. This systematic approach provides a comprehensive snapshot of your aquatic plant community, enabling us to identify dominant species, assess biodiversity, and track changes over time.</p>
    <p>We also employ cutting-edge drone technology to conduct aerial surveys of your aquatic environments. Our high-resolution drone imagery provides a bird's eye view of your waterbody, allowing us to map shoreline features, assess riparian habitat, and identify areas of concern, such as erosion or invasive species infestations.</p>
    <p>In addition to plant and shoreline surveys, we specialize in bathymetric mapping to characterize the underwater topography of your waterbody (not intended for navigation). Using advanced sonar technology, our team collects high-density depth measurements across your lake or pond, creating a detailed map of the bottom contours. This information is essential for understanding water volume, habitat structure, and sediment distribution, and can inform a wide range of management decisions such as aeration options.</p>
    <p>Our advanced survey techniques provide a wealth of data that can be used to develop targeted management strategies, prioritize restoration efforts, and monitor the effectiveness of interventions over time.</p>"`,
